Easy to install addons to come.

# Install

We use a CLI tool called [jx](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx) to interact with Jenkins X.  For installation `jx` delegates to [Helm](https://helm.sh/) (Kubernetes Package manager) for install, upgrades and uninstall operations.

Grab the latest [jx](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/releases/latest) and choose the type of cluster you want to create.
## Remote cluster install

The quickest way to get going is with [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/), other major cloud providers coming shortly.

__Prerequisite__ you will need a Google Cloud Account with a Google Project setup, follow this link for a free trial along with $300 credit https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial

```
jx create cluster gke
```
And follow the CLI wizard.

## Local development

For local development we can install Jenkins X with minikube.

First install the Hyperkit driver https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/docs/drivers.md#hyperkit-driver

```
git clone https://github.com/jenkins-x/cloud-environments && cd cloud-environments
jx create cluster minikube --local-cloud-environment=true
```

## Accessing applications

You can list the external URLs used to access applications on your kubernetes cluster by running:
```
jx open
```
