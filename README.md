## Remote cluster install

If you are installing on a remote Kubernetes cluster, head over to the cloud environments repo which includes entire environments that install out of the box, preconfigured for you cloud provider with [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) and [Azure Container Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/container-service/), [Amazon Elastic Container Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) to come shortly.

## Local development

Best way to get started is with minikube.

These steps are for OSX for others OS please see the docs https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#installation.

First install the Hyperkit driver https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/docs/drivers.md#hyperkit-driver

Next get minikube
```
brew cask install minikube
```

This repo has some helper commands to get you started

```
git clone https://github.com/jenkins-x/jenkins-x-platform && cd jenkins-x-platform
minikube start --vm-driver hyperkit --cpus 4 --memory 4096
```
We use `helm` as the package manager and install / upgrade features so to get the binary and install an nginx ingress controller so we can access our apps run:
```
make setup
```
to install Jenkins-X on minikube:
```
make install
```
now you can edit charts and apply the chages using:
```
make upgrade
```
to clean up run:
```
make delete
```

## Accessing applications

You can list the external URLs used to access applications on you kubernetes cluster by running:
```
kubectl get ingress
```
